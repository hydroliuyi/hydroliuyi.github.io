Yi Liu works at School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Guangxi University as a Assistant Professor now in Nanning, China.

Yi Liu works on new methods and techniques of remote sensing and eco-hydrological models. Yi studies the water-carbon coupling process (ET and GPP) of the terrestrial ecosystem with the vegetation interface processes model (FORTRAN code) using remote sensing and eddy covariance, and ready to further study the theory and application of water and carbon cycles.

Before joining Guangxi University, Yi obtained his B.S. degree from Sichuan University and Ph.D. degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. From 2021 to 2023, Yi worked at the China Geological Survey.
